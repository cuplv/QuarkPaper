\begin{abstract}
  We propose a runtime-assisted approach to enforce convergence in
  distributed executions of replicated data types. The key
  distinguishing aspect of our approach is that it guarantees
  convergence \emph{unconditionally} -- without requiring data type
  operations to satisfy algebraic laws such as commutativity and
  idempotence. Consequently, programmers are no longer obligated to
  prove convergence on a per-type basis. Moreover, our approach lets
  sequential data types be reused in a distributed setting by
  extending their implementations rather than refactoring them.  The
  novel component of our approach is a distributed runtime that
  orchestrates \emph{well-formed } executions that are guaranteed to
  converge. Despite the utilization of a runtime, our approach comes
  at no additional cost of latency and availability. Instead, we
  introduce a novel tradeoff against a metric called \emph{staleness},
  which roughly corresponds to the time taken for replicas to
  converge. We implement our approach in a system called \quark and
  conduct a thorough evaluation of its tradeoffs. 
%%We also briefly discuss the utility of our approach in
%%realizing causal coherency semantics in shared-memory concurrent
%%systems,

  We thank the anonymous reviewers and our shepherd Doug Lea for their
  thoughtful comments. First author has benefited from discussions
  with Anmol Sahoo and Suresh Jagannathan. Anmol has also developed
  and maintained the OCaml-Scylla library, which is a key piece of
  infrastructure underlying \quark.
